# Godot Engine

**[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.** It provides a comprehensive set of [common tools](https://godotengine.org/features),
so that users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), 
mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as web-based platforms and [consoles](https://doc.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/platform/consoles.html)

## Free, open source and community driven

Godot is completely free and open source under the very permissive [MIT license](https://godotengine.org/license). No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The user's games are theirs, down to the last line of
engine code. Godot's development is fully independent and community driven, empowering users to help shape their engine match their expectations. It is supported by the Godot foundation not for profit.

## Community and contributing
Godot is not only an engine but an ever-growing community of users and engine developers. The main community channels are listed [on the homepage](https://godotengine.org/community).
